Hello there, I am Michal. I am a self-driven and diligent professional with a vast range of technical and interpersonal skills, with prior experience in working in the engineering consultancy. As a distinctive MSc Data Science graduate, I have developed excellent programming skills through my degree and key communication skills through my work as an engineer. I work comfortably in a team or individually under time and stress restraints. I am a highly organized, committed and positive individual, who is eager to work and learn from others.

I have created this website to show my own projects displaying comprehensive solutions to Data Science and Machine Learning problems. Have a look at my ['Project Portfolio'](https://mphamsy.github.io/projects/) to review each project in detail. Feel free to have a review of my ['Master's Thesis'](https://mphamsy.github.io/publications/) about prepreprocessing strategies of Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) for Question Generation.

If you are interested in getting in touch with me or if you have any questions, best to contact me via email, phone or let's get connected on [Linken In](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/micha%C5%82-pham-sy-a64683122). My curriculum vitae is available in the [CV](https://mphamsy.github.io/cv/) tab.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
