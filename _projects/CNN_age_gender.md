### **Requirements**
This project is written in Python and requires the following libraries to be **installed** and **imported**. The project is undertaken with GoogleColab with images stored locally.

### **Dataset**
The dataset chosen for this project is a fraction of the UTKFace dataset containing facial images of people aged from 0 to 116 with resolution of 128x128. These types of datasets are important and widely used for computer vision tasks. This assignment will only use a fraction of the dataset, which will equate to 5000 images total. These images will be split for training, test and validation purposes.

- The training dataset size:  4000
- The testing dataset size: 1000

The information about gender, age and ethncity are encoded within each **filename**. The information is presented as following:

```
Sample Filename: 96_1_2_20170110175716420.jpg.chip.jpg
Encoded Meaning: Age_Gender_Ethnicity_Timestamp.jpg.chip.jpg
```

The visualisation of the dataset is provided below. 20 imagess are displayed 

### **Pre-processing**

### **Data Augmentation**

### **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

### **Plots and Results**
